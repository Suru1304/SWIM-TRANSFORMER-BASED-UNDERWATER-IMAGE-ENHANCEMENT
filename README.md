## QuickStart
### Attention: Please ensure the pytorch version be same with requirements.txt

### Start a custom training
We have put demo data in folder "_./dataset_", hence you can run file "_*Enh_train.py_" in  folder "_./scripts_".

###Start a test with pre-trained model
If you want to use the pre-trained model for testing, please read the following content about data settings. After that, run file "*Enh_eval.py" in folder "./scripts".
